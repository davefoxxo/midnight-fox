## Midnight Fox theme

A clean, dark theme for VSCode with vibrant colours and bold accents.

**Psssst!** This theme is still early release, I certainly have missed a few things here and there. If something doesn't look right, tell me on my email :)

How to install:
---------------

Either look up `midnight fox` on VSCode extentions, OR

1. In VSCode, press <kbd>CTRL / CMD</kbd> + <kbd>SHIFT</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>

2. Type in the following command:

```
ext install midnight-fox
```

This will exactly search up my theme. Don't forget the hyphen!
